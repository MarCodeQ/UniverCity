Link the conceptual schema design approach to its activities

1. Design a schema (or view) for each user group or application based only on its own requirements;
merge/integrate these schemas into a global conceptual schema for the entire database;
after that, reconstruct the individual views as external schemas

2. Identify the abstraction of the database structure, meaning (semantics), interrelationships, and constraints
design the conceptual schema of the database; after that, specify external schemas for the various user groups and applications

3. Merge all the requirements of the different applications and user groups into a single set of requirements before schema design begins;
design the conceptual schema of the database; after that, specify external schemas for the various user groups and applications

There are 3 options to choose:
The view integration approach and the centralized (or one-shot) schema design approach
The view integration approach Identify the abstraction of the database structure,
The centralized(or one - shot) schema design approach
